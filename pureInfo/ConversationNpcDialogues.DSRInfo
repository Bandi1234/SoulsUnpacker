10	[Yes, indeed.]
100000	[He has the key.]
100101	[Ah, hello!]
100102	[Oh, ah-hah! So, I didn't scare you?]
100103	[Oh, yes! Wonderful!]
100104	[Oh, hello there. I will stay behind, to gaze at the sun.]
100105	[Oh, hello. You're still keen on speaking to me?]
100106	[Hrg!]
100107	[If a stubborn beast you be, I have no choice!]
100108	[Why, you...]
100200	[Oh, there you are.]
100201	[You really are fond of chatting with me, aren't you?]
100202	[Oh, hello there.]
100203	[Yes, well, each has one's beliefs.]
100204	[Oh, hello there. Still here?]
100205	[Oh, hello there.]
100206	[Hmm! Ah, oh...hello there.]
100207	[Oh, hello there.]
100300	[...Hrg, rg...Arrrgh...]
100301	[...Ahh, it's over...]
100400	[...Why?...Why?...]
110000	[Well, you are a rare visitor.]
110001	[Hmm. You have survived. Impressive.]
110002	[Hmm. So, you have received a revelation?]
110003	[Hmm. You have made it back. Very well.]
110004	[Hm, what is it?]
110005	[What!]
110006	[Very well. So be it.]
110007	[...But, how...]
110008	[Tis a pity...To think I saw potential in you...]
110009	[So...It was you, was it?]
110010	[What you saw under light of the Darkmoon shall haunt you forever.]
110011	[Will you be departing soon,]
110012	[Oh...You are one of us.]
110013	[Have you heard of Seath the Scaleless?]
110014	[The bonfires attended by the Keepers are special.]
120000	[...Oh, you... You're no Hollow, eh?]
120001	[...Thank you...]
120002	[...Yes, I see...]
120003	[Hrggkt...]
120004	[...The key is there...]
120100	[A pleasure to meet you.]
120101	[I am preparing to leave.]
120102	[A pleasure to meet you.]
120103	[I am preparing to leave.]
120200	[Well, how long has it been? Glad to see you safe.]
120201	[...What if we were to join forces? How about that?]
120202	[Very well.]
120203	[Yes, I see...]
120204	[Things appear to have settled.]
120300	[...So, it was you...I had a feeling...]
120301	[...I have waited for thee...]
130000	[Mm, you seem quite lucid! A rare thing in these times.]
130001	[Oh, heavens, thank you. I'm saved.]
130002	[Oh, hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead.]
130004	[I fail to see your design,]
130005	[Heavens...the folly of youth...]
130100	[There you are. I was expecting you.]
130101	[Hello there. You really are very diligent.]
130102	[Hello there.]
130103	[Hello there. What have you been up to?]
130104	[Hello there. I was expecting you.]
130105	[Hello there. Glad to see you alive.]
130106	[Hello there. Glad to see you alive.]
130107	[I will stay here for the time being.]
130108	[No results, eh...]
130109	[Farewell.]
130110	[Heading out, are you?]
130200	[Hello again! What a chance meeting this is!]
130201	[Oh, thank you very much. I'm saved.]
130202	[Hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead.]
130206	[Hello there. I was expecting you.]
130207	[Hello there. You really are very diligent.]
130208	[Oh, there you are, it has been a while.]
130209	[Come again.]
130210	[Come again, any time you please.]
130211	[Farewell.]
130212	[Mm...mm...]
130213	[Ah, the secret of Seath's immortality?]
130214	[The tomes stored in these Archives are truly magnificent.]
130215	[...Who are you...]
140000	[Somebody! Please, let me out of here!]
140001	[Oh, hello.]
140002	[Ooph!]
140003	[Curses, you leave me no choice!]
140004	[Rrrg...]
140100	[Oh, hello.]
140102	[Oh, hello.]
140103	[Oh, hello.]
140104	[Good-bye, then.]
140105	[All right. That'll do it.]
140106	[Hm? What's that?]
140107	[No matter. Let us continue.]
140108	[Have you heard of Big Hat Logan?]
140109	[Ahh, yes, the note that Master Logan left?]
140110	[I wish to do what I can to locate Master Logan.]
140112	[Oh, hello again!]
140113	[Oh, hello.]
140114	[Have you spoken to Master Logan?]
140115	[Have you ever cast one of Logan's spells?]
140116	[Oh, there you are! Just so you know...]
140117	[Oh, hello, you made it!]
140118	[It's not that I am concerned for Master Logan's welfare.]
140119	[Ohh! Master Logan is at the Archives?!]
140120	[Oh, hello.]
140121	[I have decided to seek the Regal Archives.]
140122	[Uwwah!]
140123	[Damn...you've lost it, haven't you?]
140124	[Rrrg...]
140125	[Did you see them?]
140126	[Two things are required for sorcery.]
150000	[So, it is thou who rescueth me?]
150001	[Yes, of course...I understand well.]
150003	[Ahh...]
150005	[I am Dusk of Oolacile.]
150006	[If thou art in need, pray summon me again.]
150007	[If thou art in need, pray summon me again.]
150008	[Wait, where... are...]
150009	[Thou hast return'd. Bless thee.]
150011	[For a very long time, I was trapped within the Crystal Golem.]
150012	[The sorceries of Oolacile differ from the magic of thine age.]
150013	[My home of Oolacile was reduced to ashes, long ago, in my time.]
160000	[...]
160001	[...Th, thank you...]
160002	[...Forgive me...]
160003	[...Frampt has told me of you...]
160004	[Mm...]
160005	[Ah...]
170000	[You are Undead, as well?]
170001	[Did I not explain the urgency of our tasks?]
170003	[Are you a heretic, or just plain Hollow?]
170004	[Hrgkt! Eeg...]
170005	[O piteous soul...]
170008	[Hello...I will never forget what you did.]
170009	[Would a Miracle be of any help to you?]
170010	[I am most pleased to find you in good health.]
170011	[I was wondering when you might return.]
170012	[Oh! Please, forgive me. I was absorbed in prayer.]
170013	[Then, be safe.]
170014	[Vince and Nico were fooled by a lout named Patches, and turned into Hollows.]
170015	[I do not warm easily to unfamiliar faces.]
170017	[Why on earth would you...]
170018	[Dear Vince, dear Nico...]
170100	[You're no Hollow, are you?]
170101	[You banished those two Hollows, did you?]
180000	[Hello there. I believe we are not acquainted?]
180001	[Hello there.]
180002	[Oh, my... you again?]
180003	[Oh, you yet again?]
180004	[Hrg!]
180005	[By the Lords! You damn fool!]
180006	[N...no...this can't be...]
180100	[Uh, oh, you again?]
180101	[Your Highness...where have you gone?]
180102	[Oh, hello there.]
180103	[In the depths of the Catacombs, M'lady slipped off the giant's coffin and into a hole.]
180104	[...Ah, oh, you. Have you seen M'lady?]
180105	[Are, are you sure?! Then M'lady...]
180106	[...Oh, it's you...]
180107	[Hrgkt!]
180108	[What is it, fool? Driven to madness by emotion?]
180109	[Rrk! Why...how could I...]
180110	[Fool...What were you thinking?]
180111	[Oh, hello...]
180112	[Very well. Then first, a Covenant with the Gods.]
180113	[That is a shame. But each to their own.]
180114	[Oh, hello.]
180115	[Oh, hello.]
180116	[Oh, hello.]
180117	[Come again.]
180118	[My guests have finally arrived.]
180119	[My companions are M'lady and her young knights.]
180120	[An Undead mission?]
180121	[Very well. I can surely tell you, of all people...]
180122	[I am afraid that may be difficult. For our missions are sacred.]
180123	[Reah is the youngest daughter of the good house of Thorolund.]
180124	[Oh, I'm sorry. Miracles, was it?]
180200	[Help me!]
180201	[You there, please, help me...]
180202	[Phew...I am saved.]
180203	[Please, rest assured.]
190000	[Hm? What have we here?]
190001	[Oh, you again. What business have you?]
190002	[Oh, you yet again. You're a persistent one, aren't you? Hah hah hah.]
190003	[Oh, it's you?]
190005	[Curses! What the devil's wrong with you?]
190006	[By the Gods...]
20	[Only, in the ancient legends it is stated,]
200000	[Mnnn...]
200001	[Mnnn...]
200002	[Mnnn...]
200003	[Mnnn...]
200004	[Mnnn...]
200005	[Mnnn...]
200006	[Mnnn...]
200007	[Mnnn...]
200008	[Mnnn...]
200009	[Mnnn...]
210000	[Thou hast journey'd far, and overcome much, chosen Undead.]
210001	[O chosen Undead.]
210002	[O Chosen Undead.]
210003	[Now thou shalt go forth, chosen Undead.]
210005	[Aieegh...]
210006	[Magnificent...Thou hast filled the Lordvessel.]
220000	[Thou that tarnisheth the Godmother's image.]
220001	[Heretic...]
220002	[O Heretic, swathed in Dark...]
220003	[Halt!]
220005	[Welcome back, Blade of the Darkmoon.]
220006	[Very well, Blade of the Darkmoon.]
220008	[What foolishness...]
220009	[O Disciple of the Dark Sun.]
220010	[Very well. Now thou art a Blade of the Darkmoon.]
220011	[Very well.]
230000	[...Hrr...rrgg...]
230001	[...Th-thank you.]
230002	[Oh, hello there.]
230003	[Whoa!]
230004	[Curse the heavens! Are you mad!]
230005	[Curses...]
230100	[Well, I see you made it out!]
230101	[Oh, hello, there.]
230103	[Good-bye, then.]
230104	[Good-bye, then.]
230105	[Wait, friend!]
230106	[That was rather abrupt.]
230107	[Whoa!]
230108	[You detest my pyromancy! That must be it!]
230109	[Aaahhhh...]
230110	[Pyromancy is the art of casting fire.]
230111	[Pyromancy has a, well, rather primitive aspect to it.]
230112	[My teacher, whom I imagine still resides in the Great Swamp,]
230113	[In this land, pyromancers earn a certain respect.]
230114	[Ah, hello, there.]
230115	[Why, yes, of course!]
230116	[...I see. I suppose I was mistaken.]
230117	[A pyromancer's flame is a part of his own body.]
240000	[Go back.]
240001	[Those who defy the pact...]
240002	[Ahh, a precious new sacrifice!]
240003	[Welcome, bringer of meat.]
250000	[Quelaag?]
250001	[Quelaag, what is it?]
250003	[Good-bye, Quelaag.]
250004	[Good-bye, Quelaag.]
250005	[Why, Quelaag!]
250006	[Quelaag, what was that?]
250007	[Enter a Covenant? Again?]
250010	[Ah...]
250012	[Quelaag...]
250013	[Quelaag, my dear sister...]
250014	[Quelaag, my dear sister...]
250015	[I'll be fine, I have you, dear sister.]
250016	[Quelaag?]
250017	[...Ooh!]
250018	[Ahh...]
250019	[...?]
260000	[...Oh dear...What have we here? Are you a new servant?]
260001	[What is it? Go along, and meet Our Fair Lady.]
260002	[The nerve of you! Be gone, be gone at once!]
260003	[...You, you speak the tongue of the Fair Lady?]
260004	[Are you prepared to dedicate yourself to Our Fair Lady?]
260005	[You again...]
260006	[Are you in need already?]
260007	[There is no time for idle chat.]
260008	[...There is nothing to say to you...]
260009	[Well!]
260010	[Well!]
260011	[Oh, hello.]
260012	[Oh, hello...A pleasure to see you again.]
260013	[In all honesty, I am envious.]
260014	[Worse than Undead, we are diseased, and unwanted.]
260015	[Hrgkt!]
260016	[I knew it! I knew it!]
260017	[Hrg...rgggkt...]
260018	[Why, youuuuu monster...!]
260019	[Below us lies the ruins of the legendary city of Izalith.]
260020	[Have you heard of Lost Quelana?]
260021	[Incidentally, do you have an interest in pyromancy?]
260022	[You have served our Fair Lady well.]
260023	[...Well, fine. I will not force you.]
270000	[Hmm...A mere Undead, yet you can see me? Fascinating...]
270001	[Ah, there you are.]
270002	[No luck, hmm...]
270003	[Now, go.]
270004	[Hm? What's the rush?]
270005	[What was that? You are a peculiar one.]
270007	[Hmm...The voice of reason fails?]
270008	[Farewell, my mother, my sisters...]
270009	[Long ago, I accepted another pupil, like yourself.]
270010	[Pyromancy is the art of invoking and manipulating fire.]
270011	[The Witch of Izalith?]
270012	[...Hmm...]
270013	[Outstanding...You have done very well.]
270014	[I can hardly thank you enough.]
280000	[Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except for ghosts.]
280001	[Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except ghosts.]
280002	[Hello again. How are you?]
280003	[Hello, there. Where have you been? I'm glad to see you well.]
280004	[Well, hello there. Have you been cursed?]
280005	[Hello, there. Cursed again?]
280009	[Hello there. What is it?]
280010	[...You've broken the seal, have you?...]
280011	[According to legend, the knight Artorias crossed the Abyss,]
280012	[...Magnificent. You defeated the Four Kings.]
280013	[Oh, hello.]
280014	[Oh, hello.]
280015	[Oh, hello. You've acquired the Lordvessel, have you?]
280016	[Well, this is a surprise. I get few visitors, save for ghosts.]
280017	[Oh, hello.]
280018	[Hate to ask, really.]
280019	[You, you have defeated the Darkwraith!]
280020	[I am the Guardian of the Seal.]
280021	[New Londo was sacrificed to contain the Darkwraiths.]
280022	[Long ago, the Four Kings were powerful men. Only, their hearts were weak.]
280023	[What! No!]
290000	[Well, you must be a new arrival.]
290001	[Well, hello again.]
290002	[Most weapons and armour are mighty sturdy indeed.]
290003	[There are two types of weapon forging. There's reinforcement, and there's ascension.]
290004	[You can forge armour just like you do weapons.]
290005	[This is the old church.]
290006	[Sen's Fortress is an old proving grounds built by the ancient gods.]
290007	[Oi, where're you off to?]
290008	[What's going on with you, eh?]
290009	[Ow!]
290010	[Well, you've got some nerve!]
290011	[Curses, you damn backstabber...]
290012	[Ahh, why, that's a fine ember you have there.]
290013	[I see...'Tis a pity...]
290014	[Magnificent! You won't be disappointed.]
290015	[My, that's a rare ember you have there.]
290016	[I see...'Tis a pity...]
290017	[Well, thanks for that!]
290018	[Oh, my, what a brilliant ember you have there.]
290019	[I see...'Tis a pity...]
290020	[Ah-hah! Splendid, splendid! Thank you!]
290021	[Hrm? Show me that ember of yours...]
290022	[Are you sure? Well, fair enough.]
290023	[Yes, well! Thank you.]
290024	[Hmm, that's an odd ember you have there.]
290025	[I'll be seeing you, then.]
290026	[Don't get yourself killed.]
290027	[I know little of the Darkroot Garden.]
290028	[Oh, yes, and one other thing about the Darkroot Garden.]
30	[What foolishness...]
300000	[...Be gone with you!]
300001	[...What's that, then? Need some smithing?]
300003	[Well, what was that about?]
300004	[If that'll be all, then be gone with you!]
300005	[Now where've you gone?]
300006	[...You've got rotten manners.]
300007	[Bah!]
300008	[Trying to cause trouble, are you?]
300009	[Curses...]
300010	[...Hmph? Why, is that...]
300011	[Hmm, hmm, yes, yes, I see...]
300012	[Yes, yes, very well! We'll get these old bones to work!]
300013	[...Hmph? Why, that's...]
300014	[Hmm, hmm...Fine, then...]
300015	[Keh heh heh heh heh!]
300016	[...Hmph? Why, you have...]
300017	[...Hmph! I'm here to smith, not to chit chat.]
300018	[...I've told you, I'm here for the trade, not for the talk!]
300019	[Enough with your presence. It disturbs me.]
300020	[Well, you are a persistent one, are you not? ]
300021	[I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...]
300022	[I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...]
310000	[Who are you?]
310001	[Mng. Hello.]
310002	[Cometh soon.]
310003	[Cometh soon.]
310004	[Mng, hmng?]
310005	[Hello again.]
310006	[Oww.]
310007	[Oi!]
310008	[Angh, uggghh...]
310009	[Mng. What's that?]
310010	[Hmph, 'tis pity...]
310011	[I hath shiny-shiny,]
310012	[Talk, 'tis no good.]
310013	[Talk, 'tis no good.]
310014	[But you, friend.]
310015	[You come,]
310016	[You come,]
310017	[You weak.]
320000	[Hrm?]
320001	[Oh, hello.]
320002	[Come back soon.]
320003	[Good-bye, then.]
320004	[Hm? What's happened?]
320005	[What was that about?]
320007	[Damn, you've gone Hollow, have you?]
320008	[No...impossible...]
320009	[Hey, hang on...]
320010	[...Yes, I see. All right, fine.]
320011	[Yes, as you should!]
320012	[Hey, hang on...]
320013	[...Fine.]
320014	[Oh, really! You are wonderful!]
320015	[Hey, hang on...]
320016	[Hm? What is it?]
320017	[Old Big Hat? Of course I've heard of him.]
320018	[Sorcery? Don't ask me how it actually works.]
330000	[Well, now...]
330001	[Oh, you again?]
330002	[Hmph!]
330003	[Thank you kindly.]
330004	[Hey, what! What's the matter?]
330005	[What was that about?]
330006	[Eeg!]
330007	[You've gone mad, have you!?]
330008	[Why, me...]
330009	[Ah, this one? Ain't she lovely?]
330010	[Ah, you can forget it.]
330011	[Eh? My wares?]
330012	[Now, don't squander your time chatting!]
330013	[Eh? I'm not here to chit-chat.]
330014	[Things are getting treacherous in these parts.]
330015	[It's actually quite nice here, you know?]
340000	[Hmm, you still have your senses about you?]
340001	[Oh, there you are, dearie!]
340002	[Drat.]
340003	[Come again, if you please!]
340004	[Don't run off!]
340005	[What's the matter with you!]
340006	[Why, you!]
340007	[What do you think you're doing?!]
340008	[A curse upon you...]
340009	[You've come to this land at a bad time.]
340010	[I forage moss.]
340011	[Ah, go down along the side to reach the depths of the Undead Burg.]
340012	[This is a wonderful place, don't you think?]
340013	[Tell me honestly...]
350000	[...Hrrg...]
350001	[...]
350002	[...]
350003	[Nothing at all?]
350004	[Go along, try and make something of yourself.]
350005	[...Hmm?]
350006	[...Hm, fine, fine. I understand.]
350007	[Hrgro!]
350008	[What the devil's got into you!]
350009	[Hrrggahh...]
350010	[There's nothing more to say.]
350011	[Let me give you a nibble of advice.]
350012	[Where do I get all my things?]
360000	[Aye, siwmae.]
360001	[Aye, siwmae.]
360002	[Aye, siwmae.]
360003	[Aye, siwmae.]
360004	[Thank you. That was a fine trade.]
360005	[Well, that is a shame, then.]
360006	[Hold on, there!]
360007	[What problem do you have now?]
360008	[By the Lords...why...]
360009	[Hmm...]
360010	[Hmm...]
360011	[Hmm...]
360012	[Hmm...]
370000	[Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival.]
370001	[Hm? What, you want to hear more?]
370002	[Bloody hell, what is it now?]
370003	[What's wrong? Get a bit of a scare out there?]
370004	[Why, what a surprise. I didn't expect you to make it.]
370005	[Did you see that hoity-toity cleric? He went through the graveyard and down into the Catacombs.]
370006	[Have you been to the ruins of New Londo below?]
370007	[How did that silly sorcerer's apprentice end up?]
370008	[How did that raggedy old chum end up?]
370009	[That cleric was spared?]
370010	[How did that nutty sorcerer make it back?]
370011	[How did that old man make it back?]
370012	[Don't you ever think to forge your weapons?]
370013	[Oh, have you seen that terribly morose lass?]
370014	[Oh, your face! You're practically Hollow.]
370015	[Hm, what? Restoring your humanity?]
370016	[What are you looking at?]
370017	[Oi, hold on...Don't tell me, have you been cursed?]
370018	[Big Hat Logan, the legendary sorcerer, in the flesh!]
370019	[Did you see her?]
370020	[Did you hear about the maiden?]
370021	[That maiden?]
370022	[Did you ring the second bell?]
370023	[Damn, that stench...And I was really beginning to like it here!]
370024	[You again?]
370025	[Hm? What now?]
370026	[Well, what are you going to do?]
370027	[Ooph!]
370028	[Lousy rat! You have some nerve!]
370029	[Heheh, not too shabby...]
370030	[Now, that's just embarrassing.]
370031	[Don't you ever think to forge your weapons?]
380000	[Mmm...]
380001	[Mmm...mmm...]
380002	[Still closed...]
380004	[Yeeg!]
380005	[That's your game, is it?]
380006	[Heavens, me...]
380007	[Mmm...mmm...]
380008	[Mn, mmm...Ah, so you see my plight?]
380009	[Perhaps I could try some rolling...]
380100	[Mmm...]
380101	[Ah, you again!]
380102	[This is quite a fix...]
380103	[Mmm...mmm...]
380200	[Mmm...mmm...]
380201	[I require a key to exit.]
380203	[Ahh! There you are! Bless you!]
380204	[Ahh, hello, there.]
380300	[Mmm...]
380301	[Mmm...mmm...]
380302	[Mmm...mmm...]
380303	[What about you? Any ideas?]
380304	[Mmm...mmm...]
380400	[Sng...sng...]
380401	[Sng...sng...]
380402	[The Poison Swamp...]
380403	[Mmm...]
380600	[Sng...sng...]
380601	[Sng...sng...]
380602	[...]
380603	[...]
380604	[Hng...hng...]
380605	[Hng...hng...]
380700	[Well! Fancy meeting you here.]
380701	[There you are.]
380702	[Hello, friend. Still holding up?]
380703	[Oh, hello, friend.]
380704	[Oh, hello, friend.]
390000	[It was you who rescued me? Why, thank you.]
390001	[Oh! Have you seen my father?]
390003	[Yes, now I see.]
390004	[Oh, how can this be...!]
390005	[Rest assured. I will kill you as many times as it takes.]
390200	[Oh, hello again.]
390201	[Well, hello again!]
390202	[My father? He went on his final adventure.]
390300	[My father...all Hollow now...has been subdued. He will cause no more trouble.]
390301	[Oh, father...dear father...]
40	[What foolishness...]
400000	[Oh? Still human, are you?]
400001	[Thank you, yes, sincerely.]
400002	[Yes, very sorry, your reward will have to wait.]
400004	[You leave me no choice.]
400005	[You despicable...]
400100	[Ahh, hello there.]
400101	[Hm, you again? What is it?]
400102	[Ahh, you certainly are keeping busy.]
400200	[Why, you...How far will you come?!]
400201	[Tsk!]
400202	[Well! You again?]
400203	[So, here we go again!]
400204	[Have you heard of Trusty Patches?]
410000	[I've heard all about you.]
410001	[Ah, did you notice that one? Sharp eyes!]
410002	[Don't worry, now.]
410003	[Hrg!]
410004	[Turning on us from the very start?]
410005	[Hiyaah!]
410006	[You poor fool...]
410007	[You sick Hollow...]
410100	[Hello again.]
410101	[We meet again.]
410102	[Well, there you are again.]
410103	[I see you have a sharp eye for trinkets.]
410104	[Right then. I'll see you in the forest.]
410105	[Right then. I'll be seeing you.]
410106	[Have you heard of Chaos Blade?]
410107	[Why, look at you!]
410108	[Excellent! Much gratitude!]
410109	[...Yes, quite alright, I cannot blame you.]
410110	[Don't you run away! Be still you rat!]
410111	[This is what you get for crossing me.]
410112	[Red...the colour of blood...]
410113	[By the devils...]
410114	[What a wonderful specimen...Like slicing through butter...]
410115	[Your ambitions have sealed your fate.]
420000	[Good day! You look reasonably sane!]
420001	[Yeah? What is it now?]
420002	[Ah, oh! Well, well, how are you, then?]
420003	[Oh, does it really matter that much?]
420004	[Ah, oh! Well, how are you, then?]
420005	[Are you certain?!]
420006	[Oh, really? Yes, I see...Righty-oh!]
420007	[Oh, will you come off it, now!]
420009	[All right, all right, if that's the way it is!]
420010	[Curses...I'm finished...]
420011	[Phew...The righteous prevail, again...]
420013	[Curses, what's wrong with you!]
420014	[Curses! How in the...]
420015	[What happened to you?]
420100	[Good day! You look reasonably sane!]
420101	[Yes, I guessed as much.]
420102	[No? Really?]
420103	[What, you again? Well, well!]
420104	[What, you again? Well, well!]
420105	[There, that hole. Take a closer look.]
420106	[What's your problem?]
420107	[Heh heh, you got what you deserve!]
420108	[Heh heh, this is what I do, my friend.]
420109	[...Oh, you, I...]
420110	[Oh, brilliant! A second chance! Wonderful!]
420111	[Oh, for heaven's sake, let's not mope about, eh?]
420112	[Blimey, how did you...]
420113	[I did you wrong. But, I didn't mean it.]
420200	[Oh, we meet again. How many of you are there?]
420201	[Oh, you again. Fancy that.]
420202	[Oh, there you are again.]
420203	[What, nothing appeals to you?]
420204	[Come on, you can do better than that.]
420205	[Right? Good stuff, eh?]
420206	[How is it? Fine stuff, eh?]
420207	[Oi, have you met Lautrec the Embraced?]
420208	[Oi, have you met Petrus, that self-proclaimed cleric?]
420209	[Here, have you met that sunbathing Solaire?]
420210	[Here, have you met that backwoods Shiva?]
430000	[Hmgg...Hmgg...]
430001	[Ahh, hello. Was it you who rang the Bell of Awakening?]
430002	[Ahh, one other thing.]
430003	[I am pleased to see you well.]
430004	[Hmgg...Hmgg...]
430005	[...Hm? No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.]
430006	[What brings you here?]
430007	[What brings you here?]
430008	[Those who seek the Realm of Lords must brave Sen's Fortress, a deadly house of traps.]
430009	[Farewell.]
430010	[Heavens! You have done it! You have retrieved the Lordvessel!]
430011	[What is it? Place the Lordvessel on the altar.]
430012	[Very well.]
430013	[The beings who possess these souls have outlived their usefulness, or have chosen the path of the wicked.]
430014	[Very well.]
430015	[Are you ready?]
430016	[Ahh...ohh!]
430017	[Hmg!]
440000	[Greetings, Undead warrior.]
440001	[A wise choice, Undead warrior.]
440004	[...]
440005	[Ahh...]
440006	[What is it?]
440007	[What is it?]
440008	[Farewell.]
440009	[Hmm...You are astonishing.]
440010	[Very well!]
440011	[What is it? Place the Lordvessel upon the altar.]
440012	[Very well.]
440013	[Nonsense!]
440014	[Very well.]
440015	[Are you ready?]
440016	[Magnificent.]
440017	[My Lord, bless thy safe return.]
440018	[Undead warrior,]
440019	[They failed me, every last one of them.]
440020	[Hmg!]
460000	[Who art thou?]
460001	[Thou must returneth whence thou came.]
460002	[I expected as much from thee.]
460003	[Ahh...]
460004	[Why could thou not let us be?]
470000	[Greetings.]
470001	[Greetings, and welcome back.]
470002	[Greetings, and a pleasure to see thee again.]
470003	[Greetings. Just in time, art thee not?]
470004	[Greetings. Well, I did'st not expect to find thee Hollow.]
470005	[When thou art in need of humanity, thou shalt be welcome.]
470006	[If thou commiteth a crime, bring thyself back here.]
470007	[Stocking up on Indictments? How honourable of you.]
470008	[Thou art welcome anytime.]
470009	[Ooph!]
470010	[Thou hast made thyself clear.]
470011	[Thou shalt regret this...]
470012	[Much trouble hast thou caus'd.]
470013	[Greetings.]
470014	[Thou art a friend. For thee, a warm welcome.]
470015	[Thou appearest to lack faith, yet magnanimous are the Gods.]
470016	[Good tidings, thou art welcome.]
470017	[Hmm...]
480000	[Is it not so that thou art new.]
480001	[Well indeed, thou art a strange one! Nevertheless, I feel some liking for thee.]
480002	[I am very glad!]
480003	[Ah, thou dost cometh. How fares ye?]
480004	[Oh, thou art present!]
480005	[Oh, I see. 'Tis a pity indeed.]
480006	[Oh, thou art here.]
480007	[Hmm, I see. A result most heathenish and gross.]
480008	[Dee hee hee, dee hee hee!]
480009	[Oh, it is thee...]
480010	[Perchance...]
520000	[...]
520001	[...]
550000	[You, you.]
550001	[You! You!]
550002	[No, no.]
550003	[No, no.]
560000	[...Mmn...ahh...]
560001	[...This may strike thine ear as somewhat peculiar, but...]
560002	[Excuse me for such whimsical utterances.]
560003	[I still think on that creature from the Abyss that preyed upon me.]
560050	[Aah...]
570000	[...Whatever thou art, stay away...]
570001	[...Thou art strong, human...]
570050	[Hrgg...]
570051	[Hrgkt!]
570052	[Hrggraaah!]
580000	[Hm? A visitor, have we?]
580001	[Well, thou hast come again. This is a surprise.]
580002	[Well, thou com'st again. Thou art a strange one.]
580003	[Good morrow...Is the Black Dragon posing thee duress?]
580004	[Yes, I thought as much.]
580005	[Hah hah hah!]
580006	[...Strange. I am rarely wrong on such matters...]
580007	[A wise choice. Why foist thyself unto the fiery maw?]
580008	[The Black Dragon troubles you yet, I see.]
580009	[...Hmm, yes, I see. I was mistaken...]
580010	[...Art thou prepared to challenge great Kalameet?]
580011	[Yes, surely that is best.]
580012	[Ah, hello there. What of Kalameet?]
580013	[Why, thou hast defeated Kalameet!]
580014	[Farewell, human.]
580015	[Farewell, human.]
580016	[Farewell, proud human.]
580017	[If thou seeketh to explore this domain, be wary of a black dragon.]
580018	[I should confer...If thine was the blade to which Artorias fell.]
580019	[Me?]
580020	[Now, do not mistake my words.]
580021	[The dragons shall never be forgotten...]
580022	[Ahh, this Greatbow?]
580023	[Hm? A visitor, have we?]
580024	[I see that thou hast dusted the great black dragon Kalameet.]
580025	[Thou com'st again, legend of humans.]
580026	[I suspect thou hast taken a gander at it,]
580027	[If thine wish is to succeed poor Artorias, and challenge the spread of the Dark,]
580050	[Cease this.]
580051	[Ahh, so this is true human nature.]
580052	[Mmgraah!]
580053	[Oog!]
580054	[Arrgggg!]
580060	[Hello]
590000	[Hm...Oh, let me guess...]
590001	[Yes, of course. Exactly what happened to me.]
590002	[Oh, well, my mistake...]
590003	[Oh, still alive, are you?]
590004	[Oh, for Juniper's sake.]
590005	[Oh, you again...]
590006	[So long.]
590007	[So long.]
590008	[Did you happen across Knight Artorias?]
590009	[Did you really slay Knight Artorias?]
590010	[So, what did that giant mushroom make you do?]
590011	[Hm? I've little to talk about, really.]
590012	[What? If you've something to say, then say it!]
590013	[...Oh, you!]
590014	[I'll be seeing you.]
590015	[...Well, you've quite the nerve!]
590016	[Believe it or not,]
590050	[Oh! It's come to blows, has it?]
590051	[What now? You think this my fault?]
590052	[Ooph!]
590053	[There!]
590054	[What? Now you're feeling the heat?]
590055	[You damn fool.]
590056	[Hrrg...]
600000	[...Human...]
600001	[...That ring...]
600002	[Thank you. You are very kind.]
600003	[Yes, of course...]
600004	[What is it? Something else?]
600005	[...Then you have no business with me...]
600006	[...Are you human?]
600007	[...You, is that not...]
600050	[Hmph, you humans...]
600051	[Hrk!]
600052	[Hmph, such conceit...]
600053	[But, how...]
610000	[Well, look at this one.]
610001	[Thank you.]
610002	[Yes, I understand.]
610003	[Hast thou reconsidered?]
610004	[Yes, yes, of course.]
610005	[Thank goodness thou art safe.]
610006	[Struggling, are we?]
610007	[I have awaited thee. Thou hast rescued Princess Dusk,]
610008	[May the flames guide thee.]
610009	[Thou shalt see further on.]
610010	[Thou art from a time far, far ahead.]
610011	[Hah hah...Was thine eye, glancing hither?]
610012	[Not long ago, I had another visitor.]
610013	[I will remember thee, but I will keep thy story to myself.]
610050	[Ah!]
610051	[Aiieeek!]
