705000	[Heh heh heh... What seems to be the ruckus?]
705001	[You're finished.]
705002	[At least you know your own name.]
705003	[To break the curse.]
705004	[Oh, I'll fool you no longer...]
705010	[You must go, on a journey without rest.]
705011	[Now, go along, go along... Heh heh...]
705012	[Still determined as ever, I see... Heh heh...]
705013	[No, of course not.]
705014	[Oh, but you don't have what's needed.]
705015	[Now, go along.]
705016	[...]
705050	[A touch under the weather, are we?]
705060	[Hah hah hah...]
705070	[Still holding up, are you?]
705110	[Hah hah hah...]
705111	[...]
705150	[Hah hah hah...]
705160	[Hah hah hah...]
705210	[Hah hah hah...]
705211	[...]
705250	[Hah hah hah...]
705260	[Hah hah hah...]
723000	[That was dangerously close.]
723003	[My name is Milibeth.]
723004	[The old women were keepers of the fire.]
723005	[The old women are sisters. I am told there was a fourth.]
723050	[What are you doing!]
723060	[Have a safe journey...]
723070	[You have proven yourself to the forest.]
786000	[You, you, give us smooth.]
786001	[You! You! Give us smooth!]
786002	[You, you, that not smooth.]
786003	[Yah, yah. So nice, so smooth.]
786004	[You, you, not like that.]
786005	[You, you, no, not that.]
786006	[There, there. Thanks for you.]
786007	[Thank you. We have plenty.]
700000	[Are you...the next monarch?]
700001	[Bearer of the curse, seek misery.]
700002	[Bearer of the curse...]
700003	[Bearer of the curse...]
700004	[Bearer of the curse. I will always be at your side.]
700005	[Beyond the bonfire lies the Forest of the Giants, where a great battle precipitated the kingdom's downfall.]
700006	[The far gate is the entrance to Heide's Tower of Flame.]
700007	[Inside the giant pit...]
700008	[Over the hill and past the forest is the King's castle.]
700010	[Those who come to Drangleic seeking salvation soon lose hope, and turn Hollow.]
700011	[That tiny thing inside the ruins...]
700012	[The sign you bear will drain your very souls...]
700013	[For when the Undead dies, it is never truly dead, but only one step closer to Hollowing.]
700014	[You have acquired the soul of an Old One.]
700015	[The soul and the curse are one and the same.]
700016	[The three old souls are now yours...]
700017	[You are blessed with a myriad of souls.]
700060	[Bring an end to your journey...and mine.]
700080	[If you find an Estus Shard, bring it to me.]
700081	[Is that a shard you've found?]
704020	[What? Who are you?]
704021	[Wait, you found your way out, too! Hah!]
704022	[Ah! Back already? Ha.]
704023	[All right, what'd you forget this time? ]
704024	[Hey, what've you been up to!]
704025	[Come to see auld Gilligan, have you? Hah!]
704026	[Cheers for that! Hah hah! ]
704027	[What? Don't waste my time.]
704028	[Oi! Where're you off to now!]
704030	[Ohhh, I should've listened to the warnings. This place is flippin' mental.]
704031	[You wouldn't believe the shenanigans that happen in my business.]
704032	[That gaping hole? Hell, search me.]
704033	[Oh, yes, somebody told me that the grave of a...of a saint lies below here.]
704034	[You want to go down that awful hole? You must have lost your marbles! Heh heh!]
704035	[Well! Fine, it's not my business, anyway.]
704036	[Hah! Yes, now we see eye to eye, don't we!]
704040	[You just don't get it, do you.]
704041	[A very reasonable offer!]
704042	[Well! Really! A very generous offer indeed, especially from you!]
704043	[Hmph! Fine, it's not my business, anyway.]
704044	[Hey, this ladder's not for sale!]
704046	[What, you're heading down after all?]
704050	[You ungrateful little git!]
704060	[Ohhh, I've had enough of this place...]
704070	[Here you are my friend, you can have these, eh! It's a little bonus, you know, for your big purchase.]
741000	[You're Undead...aren't you.]
741001	[Do you know much about souls?]
741002	[There are four beings in this land with giant souls.]
741003	[Do you see the way beyond the bonfire? That will take you to the Forest of the Giants.]
741004	[Heide's Tower of Flame lies beyond the far gate.]
741005	[Have you seen that pit? That gaping hole in the earth.]
741006	[There lies a forest beyond the hills.]
741008	[The flame you see there is a bonfire.]
741009	[Long ago, a woman called a Fire Keeper watched over each bonfire.]
741010	[Did you notice any letters on the ground on the way here?]
741011	[You may notice symbols that appear upon the ground.]
741012	[Do you ever cry out for help?]
741013	[That is a wise decision.]
741014	[I see. Then, you'll have to brave this treacherous journey on your own.]
741015	[I will stay here, and pray for your safety.]
741016	[You...need my help, do you?]
741017	[I will always be here...watching over you.]
741018	[Life is a journey...and ever journey eventually leads to home.]
741019	[May you find peace on your journey...]
741020	[In a rush, are we?]
741050	[Have you come unhinged?]
741060	[I'll be moving on... I suppose...]
741070	[You have died many times, yes, I understand.]
741080	[Do you feel lonely here?]
741081	[Look at our new neighbours...]
741082	[Quite a hive of activity we are, these days.]
751007	[Oh! Hello again!]
751008	[Did you see the flame on the map?]
751009	[But there is something greatly comforting about that flame.]
751010	[I would not venture far into that hole.]
751011	[Even more flames have appeared.]
751012	[It seems that all the flames have been lit.]
751013	[Ah yes, there is something I wanted to tell you.]
751050	[I shan't die here!]
751060	[That map...It's spellbinding...]
751070	[Fate brought us together for a reason.]
754001	[Oh, you again.]
754002	[Buy something, anything...]
754003	[Don't abandon a poor old woman...]
754004	[I knew you'd be back...]
754005	[You again? Keh heh heh...]
754006	[Thank you kindly. Keh heh heh...]
754007	[Lowly times, these are...]
754008	[Keh heh heh...]
754014	[Everyone's so stingy around here.]
754015	[We call this place Majula.]
754050	[You've no respect! Die, you rotten lout!]
754060	[Keh heh heh...]
754070	[Take these, if you want them. Keh heh heh...]
761000	[Err, oh, hello there!]
761001	[Well, thank you, for coming back! Do take a look at my wares.]
761002	[Oh, hello again. I-I hope you find something of use.]
761004	[Thanks very much. And, do please come again.]
761005	[Well, I, I do hope I see you again.]
761006	[Oh, is something wrong?]
761009	[I came from the west, from Volgen.]
761010	[A group calling themselves the Blue Sentinels have gained much power in Volgen.]
761011	[Hmm...]
761015	[Oh, there you are! I-I now offer buybacks.]
761016	[Oh, I was hoping that you would come.]
761017	[Forget to buy something? Go ahead, take your time.]
761018	[I'm glad to see you safe. Take...take a look at my wares.]
761020	[Thanks very much. Do come again!]
761021	[Always open for business.]
761022	[Finished already?]
761024	[Did I mention before that I'm not from these parts?]
761025	[Have you seen that warrior lugging that giant blue sword about?]
761026	[That sword that you've got... May I, um, have a look at it?]
761027	[I considered returning to my homeland, but I've decided to stay a while longer.]
761030	[Do I know you? Sorry...apologies, I've been quite busy these days...]
761031	[Um, sorry, have we met? Oh sorry, it's just I've been awfully busy lately.]
761032	[Looking for armour? Everything I offer is quite dependable.]
761033	[You need armour? Go ahead, see what I'm offering.]
761035	[Thanks for the purchase. Do come again.]
761036	[Are you sure? Well...I may sell out while you're away.]
761037	[Now, have some patience!]
761038	[I'm rich, I'm rich... Mwa hah hah!]
761050	[C-curses upon you! Enough of this!]
761060	[Did I mention I was...rich?]
761070	[In a spot of bother are we?]
762002	[What? Do you need something?]
762003	[I'll provide whatever service you need. For a fair price, of course!]
762004	[You've been long away. What would you like?]
762005	[Well, I've only one thing to provide, and we both know what that is! Heh heh...]
762006	[Visit me again, whenever you please.]
762007	[No interest? Suit yourself.]
762008	[I suppose it's about time I moved shop...]
762009	[Oi! Mind your manners!]
762011	[These stones may look all the same. but to the trained eye, each is unique.]
762013	[Drangleic...]
762020	[Oh, fancy meeting you here.]
762021	[You know how they call this place Drangleic, right?]
762022	[You see that blacksmith over there?]
762023	[I was born in a land to the west, Volgen. Famous for its merchants.]
762050	[Fine, if that's the way it is...]
762060	[Bye for now. Heh heh...]
762070	[Oh, I know! Take these.]
763020	[Oh! There you are!]
763022	[I finally tracked down my teacher.]
763023	[What a wonderful choice!]
763027	[Yes! How may I help you?]
763028	[Hello! Do you require pyromancy?]
763029	[Hello again! How have you been?]
763030	[I'm glad to see you're well!]
763031	[I'm always here, so come and see me when you're in town!]
763032	[Be safe.]
763033	[Wait! Where are you...cough...]
763034	[Master Carhillion and I are from Melfia, to the south. A land lush with sorcery and pyromancy.]
763035	[Once, Master Carhillion spoke excitedly of this land.]
763036	[It was a perilous trek across the mountains.]
763050	[How could you...]
763060	[Master... Carhillion...]
763070	[Oh, yes! These are for you!]
764000	[Who are you?]
764001	[I'm a blacksmith. I'm nothing without my tools.]
764002	[Ah, yes, very good.]
764003	[You, stand back. This is dangerous work.]
764004	[What? You again?]
764005	[You again? Can't you see that I'm busy?]
764006	[Hmph, I'd given you up for dead. Almost had me worried, really...]
764007	[I knew you'd be around soon. Go on, show me what you've got.]
764008	[I'll be around, if you make it back.]
764009	[Hmph. Don't waste my time.]
764010	[People these days...]
764011	[Drat, you're worse than my reckless daughter.]
764013	[You'll need souls to repair and improve equipment.]
764014	[Equipment can be strengthened with rare orestone. But such orestone won't come easily.]
764015	[I see that you have an ember. Where did you get it?]
764016	[My witless daughter finally came home.]
764017	[Stones? Try asking my daughter.]
764018	[Now, don't go near that scum near the pit.]
764019	[Gilligan can certainly be helpful at times, but he's a real conniver when it comes to money.]
764050	[Well, if that's what you want!]
764060	[Chloanne...I...]
764070	[How goes your journey?]
766010	[Do you seek my teachings? Very well, very well.]
766011	[Back already? Your diligence is commendable.]
766012	[Your visit is welcome. I trust you've kept up your studies.]
766013	[Oh, there you are. Do you seek my teachings?]
766014	[Young pupil, do not take my teachings lightly.]
766015	[One day, my teachings will save you.]
766016	[Young pupil, may we meet again, in Majula.]
766017	[The path is yet long, young pupil.]
766020	[The forces of magic, and souls,  lie dormant in this land.]
766021	[Use scrolls to unleash the power of sorceries.]
766030	[Oh, so you've finally decided to join us?]
766031	[Sorcery and pyromancy thrive in Melfia. I've spent much time there, trying to perfect my art.]
766032	[On my trip here, I met a strange girl once or twice.]
766034	[I sense a dark power here.]
766035	[Sorcery was created long, long ago.]
766036	[So, the girl's been here too.]
766050	[The arrogance of the young!]
766060	[Do not neglect your studies, dear pupil.]
766070	[Ah, here, a fitting gift for you.]
769010	[Oh, hello there... An honour to see you again.]
769011	[Just speak up if you're in need of miracles.]
769012	[Go ahead, then.]
769013	[May the power of miracles be with you.]
769014	[No need for miracles?]
769015	[Oh? Done so soon?]
769016	[To cast miracles, you must have strong faith in the gods.]
769017	[Miracles have been passed down through us since the First Flame.]
769018	[What is the First Flame?]
769030	[You've had quite a journey, I can see...]
769031	[Curses... Puzzled me out, have you?]
769050	[Hyahh! I've no choice, now!]
769060	[Seek...miracles...]
769070	[You deserve to have these. For your faith has truly deepened.]
777000	[Oh...Undead, are we?]
777001	[Satisfied?]
777002	[Nothing suited you, I presume?]
777003	[Oh my, haste makes waste. Hee hee hee...]
777004	[Oh...Who were you again?]
777010	[This place is already dead.]
777011	[This place is fascinating.]
777012	[Are you going to see the Old Ones?]
777013	[Once, people tried to round up the Undead and hide them away from the world.]
777014	[Why do people try so hard to be beautiful?]
777015	[You've seen that gaping hole here?]
777016	[Men develop the most peculiar fascinations.]
777017	[Well, you've grown quite a bit, haven't you?]
777018	[Have you made friends with the man by the sea?]
777019	[Did you see that oddly-formed rock behind here?]
777020	[Oh, it's you.]
777021	[You'll find a great creature far to the east.]
777022	[Trespassing into their dreams?]
777023	[It seems that we must now part.]
777027	[Hoh hoh! What's happened to you?]
786000	[You, you, give us smooth.]
786001	[You! You! Give us smooth!]
786002	[You, you, that not smooth.]
786003	[Yah, yah. So nice, so smooth.]
786004	[You, you, not like that.]
786005	[You, you, no, not that.]
786006	[There, there. Thanks for you.]
786007	[Thank you. We have plenty.]
743020	[Well, we meet again! What you doing here?]
743021	[See the old sword's caught your attention? Well, you've a good eye, then.]
743022	[I see you've taken a liking to the sword. Well, I applaud you, for you've a sharp eye.]
743023	[I've a great debt to you. And I'll never forget it.]
743050	[Very well. I, Benhart, will be honoured to chop you to pieces.]
743060	[A man's journey...is never done...]
743070	[We have outwitted death a good many times.]
744000	[Hello there. Travelling all alone in these treacherous times?]
744001	[Oh yes, you be cautious if you go any farther.]
744002	[I'll leave this one to you. I'm worried about what might be inside.]
744003	[Well, I see you managed to escape.]
744005	[Well, that was a close call! Heh heh...]
744007	[Good to see you safe.]
744050	[Oh, I can scrimmage, my friend.]
744060	[Heh heh heh...]
744070	[We went through a lot together. Take these, as a token of our friendship.]
751000	[Oh, I'm sorry. I was just...daydreaming, I think.]
751001	[Why cartography, you ask?]
751002	[I came to this land some time ago.]
751003	[Inside the mansion, I found a strange map. Like none I'd ever seen.]
751004	[Were you looking for that map?]
751005	[Incredible really, isn't it? Such a map, to be chiselled in stone...]
751006	[I'll be back in Majula soon.]
751050	[I shan't die here!]
751060	[That map...It's spellbinding...]
751070	[Fate brought us together for a reason.]
754000	[Buy something, anything... ]
754002	[Buy something, anything...]
754003	[Don't abandon a poor old woman...]
754004	[I knew you'd be back...]
754005	[You again? Keh heh heh...]
754006	[Thank you kindly. Keh heh heh...]
754007	[Lowly times, these are...]
754008	[Keh heh heh...]
754010	[My name is Melentia.]
754011	[Seemed like the battles would never end.]
754012	[They say these trees grew from the remains of the Giants.]
754013	[It's high time that I pick up and move.]
754050	[You've no respect! Die, you rotten lout!]
754060	[Keh heh heh...]
754070	[Take these, if you want them. Keh heh heh...]
692001	[Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.]
692002	[Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.]
692003	[Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.]
692004	[Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.]
692005	[Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.]
692006	[Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.]
692007	[Young Hollow.]
692008	[Peace grants men the illusion of life.]
692009	[All men trust fully the illusion of life.]
692010	[I am Aldia.]
742010	[Damn! You're tougher than you look!]
742011	[...Serves you right...Hah hah hah!]
742012	[...I did it...Hah hah!]
742013	[You did me well.]
742014	[...Serves you right...Hah hah hah!]
742015	[...Wait... ...You weren't friends with that rat, were you?]
742016	[Oh, you. What do you want?]
742017	[Your ring! That's his ring!]
742018	[You killed him, didn't you?]
742019	[You did me well.]
742020	[I see how it is. You're another slimy toad!]
742021	[Ooh, that'll leave a nasty scar!]
742050	[Do you want some? Fine enough!]
742060	[Heh... Rotten bastard...]
742070	[Here, these are for you.]
744012	[He swung at me! Please, lend me a hand!]
744013	[What misunderstanding could have caused this?]
744014	[Be cautious on your travels.]
744015	[What was he thinking?]
744016	[Ooh, that'll leave a nice scar!]
744050	[Oh, I can scrimmage, my friend.]
744060	[Heh heh heh...]
744070	[We went through a lot together. Take these, as a token of our friendship.]
775003	[Oh, we meet again, kind traveller.]
775004	[I require no payment this time. But you must bring me a Wondrous Soul.]
775011	[Come again, if it please you.]
775013	[The nature of an item is greatly influenced by the soul that was used to create it.]
775014	[What do you desire?]
775015	[Do you have a Wondrous Soul?]
775016	[Hello there. Do you have a Wondrous Soul?]
775017	[Hello there. What can I do for you?]
775022	[Come back again if you find another soul.]
775023	[Be safe.]
775024	[It's hard to believe now, but this land was once a flourishing kingdom.]
775025	[It is said that our technique originates from a strange being that inhabited this land.]
775026	[Do you find me strange? Skee hee.]
775050	[Oh, as you please...]
775060	[May we meet again.]
784000	[Something seems to be bothering you.]
784001	[But now, you are lost, bewildered by your own actions.]
784002	[Ask that your sins be forgiven.]
784003	[I, Cromwell, will pardon your sins.]
784004	[Now, now, confess your sins to me.]
784005	[When you face doubt, you are welcome here.]
784006	[We must never forget our sins.]
784007	[Whenever you are ready.]
784008	[You will always find me here.]
784009	[You seek indulgence? Then tell me of your transgression.]
784010	[...Your sin has been forgiven.]
784011	[Then, you wish to stand and face your own sins?]
784012	[Your covenant weighs upon you, and you yearn for freedom?]
784013	[Bless you. You are bound no longer.]
784014	[Ohh! You would rather endure your suffering?]
784015	[Anyone can be forgiven, as long as he is sincere.]
784050	[You are a cold beast.]
784060	[Forgive this poor soul...]
784070	[These are for you.]
700042	[Bearer of the curse.]
700043	[Listen to what the dragon says.]
700060	[Bring an end to your journey...and mine.]
752019	[Who are you...]
752020	[How goes your journey?]
752021	[My name is Lucatiel.]
752050	[If this is your wish, so be it.]
752060	[Please...find my brother...]
752070	[Please take these.]
771000	[P-please, just stay away.]
771001	[Just leave me alone, please.]
771002	[Please, just leave me alone.]
771003	[I haven't said anything strange, have I?]
771004	[Well, you're nicely hollowed, aren't you...]
771005	[This? This contains my power.]
771008	[Now, I don't have anything against humans, but how is it that you go about defining good and evil?]
771009	[Yes, I see, how very kind of you.]
771010	[I want you to kill a merchant named Gilligan.]
771011	[Yes, yes, of course. Forget that I asked.]
771012	[Heh heh heh... Fine work.]
771013	[I want you to kill one more.]
771014	[Yes, I knew I could count on you.]
771015	[I want you to kill Cale, the cartographer.]
771016	[I want you to kill one more.]
771017	[Yes, very good.]
771018	[I want you to kill Felkin. That's Felkin, the hexer.]
771020	[You could kill a dozen like that, and it wouldn't matter. I want you to kill someone of import.]
771021	[Having second thoughts?]
771022	[Your mark is the girl in Majula known as the muse.]
771023	[Yes, that's the feather.]
771024	[Now I am at peace.]
771025	[What do you require?]
771026	[Find what you wanted? Hah hah hah hah...]
771027	[Well, as you wish. Heh heh...]
771028	[Oh, no?]
771029	[Hmgh...]
771030	[I'll spend some time travelling the lands...]
771031	[By the very gods... What have you done...]
771050	[You are most intriguing. Heh heh...]
771051	[Please, stop that!]
771060	[Heh heh heh heh heh...]
771070	[These are for you.]
692001	[Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.]
692002	[Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.]
692003	[Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.]
692004	[Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.]
692005	[Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.]
692006	[Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.]
692007	[Young Hollow.]
692008	[Peace grants men the illusion of life.]
692009	[All men trust fully the illusion of life.]
692010	[I am Aldia.]
752000	[What is it?]
752001	[Phew...]
752002	[They say Drangleic brims with powerful souls.]
752003	[You are an odd one, indeed. I've always made a point of avoiding people.]
752005	[I thought that might be you. You haven't changed a bit, have you? Heh heh.]
752006	[Ah, yes, I have not thanked you for humouring me the other day.]
752007	[Our land of Mirrah is surrounded by enemies, and constantly at war.]
752008	[I was raised to wield a sword from birth.]
752009	[Have you heard of the Undead? These poor souls affected by the curse.]
752010	[I'm sorry...to burden you with talk of my fate.]
752011	[Still on the road, are you?]
752012	[I've found my thoughts growing hazy.]
752013	[I had an older brother. We learned to fence together.]
752014	[If only someone would hear my tale...]
752015	[Oh... You...]
752016	[What is this curse?]
752017	[Loss frightens me no end. Loss of memory, loss of self.]
752018	[Sometimes, I feel obsessed... with this insignificant thing called "self".]
752050	[If this is your wish, so be it.]
752060	[Please...find my brother...]
752070	[Please take these.]
753000	[Undead! Undead!]
753001	[A long, long, long time ago, the Princess, she made me, yes, just like so!]
753002	[Hah hah hah, ooh hoo hoo!]
753003	[Hah hah, heh! Here, for you!]
753004	[Gah hah hah hah hah!]
753005	[You want to guard the bell, do you?]
753006	[Ah hah hah! The Princess made me! To guard the Bell of Alken!]
753007	[Gah hah! Hah hah hah!]
753008	[Bravo, my friend, look how they've bled!]
753009	[Hah! Haaaah!]
753050	[Bah! I'll slice you to shreds!]
753060	[Forever...for true!]
753070	[Hah hah hah, ooh hoo, ohh...]
764300	[Meh heh heh...]
764301	[Hmph! Hmm! We've got a wild one here!]
764302	[Oh-hoh hoh hoh! That's it, yes, that's the way!]
764303	[I ought to fetch a new ember...]
764304	[Flame flame...I smell flame upon you.]
764305	[Oh-hoh! What a marvellous ember!]
764306	[What?!]
764307	[Flame, dear flame...]
764308	[Be gone.]
764309	[Flame, dear flame...]
764310	[From the start of time, flame allowed man to flourish.]
764311	[The power of flame, power of the gods... In the end, it is all beyond our reach.]
764350	[You've offended the flames!]
764360	[Flame, dear flame...]
764370	[If you walk with flame, then I salute you.]
768000	[Still a bit stiff, I'm afraid. Heh heh heh...]
768001	[I sense the curse within you.]
768002	[Cursed one, you lack intelligence.]
768003	[Cursed one, you lack faith.]
768004	[Hm-hmm...]
768005	[Souls! I need souls! You cursed fool!]
768006	[Feeble cursed one!]
768007	[Feeble cursed one!]
768008	[Well! This is a most peculiar soul.]
768009	[Well! This is a most charming soul.]
768010	[Well! This is a most twisted soul.]
768011	[So, how long was I sat petrified...]
768012	[Drangleic... I've never heard the name.]
768013	[The cursed ones were imprisoned within this land.]
768014	[Once people became aware of their own frailty...]
768015	[Many kingdoms rose and fell on this tract of earth; mine was by no means the first.]
768016	[Pyromancy was created by the ancient witch of fire.]
768020	[Don't just walk off, cursed one. Heh heh...]
768050	[Weak, so terribly weak...]
768060	[Weak, so terribly weak...]
768070	[Cursed one, take these.]
704000	[...Shush, you eejit, stay quiet!]
704001	[...You want to climb down here?]
704002	[...All right, it'll be just a moment...]
704003	[...Hell, of course it's not free!]
704004	[...Ahhh...Go on ahead, I won't offer this deal twice...]
704005	[...Oh, what is it? What do you need now?]
704006	[...No mate, these deals, they won't last forever...]
704007	[...Fine, then, all the best...]
704008	[...Oi! Downright rude, really...]
704009	[...Psst, have you heard?]
704010	[...There's something I heard from the other prisoners...]
704011	[...Before long, the Princess' ire transformed her into a monster...]
704012	[...That damned hag just can't let her old flame go...]
704013	[...Gods almighty...]
704045	[...What? You don't have a choice, do you!]
704050	[You ungrateful little git!]
704060	[Ohhh, I've had enough of this place...]
726000	[Who you?]
726001	[What? You want?]
726002	[Umm...You want? Want what?]
726003	[Umm...Gavlan know you.]
726004	[Make deal with Gavlan?]
726005	[Oh Gavlan, know you. What you want?]
726006	[You, again. Gavlan, meet you again.]
726007	[Many deal...many thanks! Gah hah!]
726008	[You? Go home?]
726009	[Umm...]
726050	[Umm...You strong.]
726060	[Wheel...deal...]
726070	[With Gavlan, you deal. Much, much deal.]
744008	[Well, we meet again.]
744009	[Well, good to see that you survived.]
744010	[I prefer a more cautious approach. It's hard to know who to even trust these days.]
744011	[You be careful, too, my friend. For trust can be a dangerous thing.]
744050	[Oh, I can scrimmage, my friend.]
744060	[Heh heh heh...]
744070	[We went through a lot together. Take these, as a token of our friendship.]
752000	[What is it?]
752001	[Phew...]
752002	[They say Drangleic brims with powerful souls.]
752003	[You are an odd one, indeed. I've always made a point of avoiding people.]
752005	[I thought that might be you. You haven't changed a bit, have you? Heh heh.]
752006	[Ah, yes, I have not thanked you for humouring me the other day.]
752007	[Our land of Mirrah is surrounded by enemies, and constantly at war.]
752008	[I was raised to wield a sword from birth.]
752009	[Have you heard of the Undead? These poor souls affected by the curse.]
752010	[I'm sorry...to burden you with talk of my fate.]
752011	[Still on the road, are you?]
752012	[I've found my thoughts growing hazy.]
752013	[I had an older brother. We learned to fence together.]
752014	[If only someone would hear my tale...]
752015	[Oh... You...]
752016	[What is this curse?]
752017	[Loss frightens me no end. Loss of memory, loss of self.]
752018	[Sometimes, I feel obsessed... with this insignificant thing called "self".]
752050	[If this is your wish, so be it.]
752060	[Please...find my brother...]
752070	[Please take these.]
762000	[Are you a traveller?]
762001	[I've extras, if you can pay. This is my trade, after all!]
762002	[What? Do you need something?]
762003	[I'll provide whatever service you need. For a fair price, of course!]
762004	[You've been long away. What would you like?]
762005	[Well, I've only one thing to provide, and we both know what that is! Heh heh...]
762006	[Visit me again, whenever you please.]
762007	[No interest? Suit yourself.]
762008	[I suppose it's about time I moved shop...]
762009	[Oi! Mind your manners!]
762011	[These stones may look all the same, but to the trained eye, each is unique.]
762012	[I'll trade stones for souls if you wish.]
762013	[Drangleic...]
762014	[I've searched every nook and cranny here. I suppose it's time to move on.]
762050	[Fine, if that's the way it is...]
762060	[Bye for now. Heh heh...]
762070	[Oh, I know! Take these.]
726000	[Who you?]
726001	[What? You want?]
726002	[Umm...You want? Want what?]
726003	[Umm...Gavlan know you.]
726004	[Make deal with Gavlan?]
726005	[Oh Gavlan, know you. What you want?]
726006	[You, again. Gavlan, meet you again.]
726007	[Many deal...many thanks! Gah hah!]
726008	[You? Go home?]
726009	[Umm...]
726050	[Umm...You strong.]
726060	[Wheel...deal...]
726070	[With Gavlan, you deal. Much, much deal.]
752000	[What is it?]
752001	[Phew...]
752002	[They say Drangleic brims with powerful souls.]
752003	[You are an odd one, indeed. I've always made a point of avoiding people.]
752005	[I thought that might be you. You haven't changed a bit, have you? Heh heh.]

752018	[Sometimes, I feel obsessed... with this insignificant thing called "self".]
752050	[If this is your wish, so be it.]
752060	[Please...find my brother...]
752070	[Please take these.]
766000	[Hmm...I sense power...]
766001	[Hmm...]
766010	[Do you seek my teachings? Very well, very well.]
766011	[Back already? Your diligence is commendable.]
766012	[Your visit is welcome. I trust you've kept up your studies.]
766013	[Oh, there you are. Do you seek my teachings?]
766014	[Young pupil, do not take my teachings lightly.]
766015	[One day, my teachings will save you.]
766016	[Young pupil, may we meet again, in Majula.]
766017	[The path is yet long, young pupil.]
766020	[The forces of magic, and souls,  lie dormant in this land.]
766021	[Use scrolls to unleash the power of sorceries.]
766050	[The arrogance of the young!]
766060	[Do not neglect your studies, dear pupil.]
766070	[Ah, here, a fitting gift for you.]
692001	[Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.]
692002	[Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.]
692003	[Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.]
692004	[Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.]
692005	[Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.]
692006	[Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.]
692007	[Young Hollow.]
692008	[Peace grants men the illusion of life.]
692009	[All men trust fully the illusion of life.]
692010	[I am Aldia.]
753000	[Undead! Undead!]
753002	[Hah hah hah, ooh hoo hoo!]
753003	[Hah hah, heh! Here, for you!]
753004	[Gah hah hah hah hah!]
753005	[You want to guard the bell, do you?]
753007	[Gah hah! Hah hah hah!]
753008	[Bravo, my friend, look how they've bled!]
753009	[Hah! Haaaah!]
753050	[Bah! I'll slice you to shreds!]
753060	[Forever...for true!]
753070	[Hah hah hah, ooh hoo, ohh...]
753101	[A long, long, long time ago, the Prince, he made me, yes, just like so!]
753106	[The Prince made me! To guard the Bell of Venn!]
772000	[What? Who're you?]
772002	[What? You again?]
772003	[You've quite unusual taste, don't you?]
772004	[Well? Where've you been?]
772005	[Finally decided to come and visit?]
772006	[Cheers!]
772007	[Very well, no pressure.]
772009	[Hey? Where you off to?]
772010	[I'm mainly a treasure hunter, you see. I'm only a merchant on the side.]
772011	[I roam about, looking for a find, following my instincts.]
772012	[I don't care what a thing is worth. What matters is whether it grabs me.]
772013	[Do I enjoy what I do? Well...that's a good question.]
772014	[But I suppose I must, I...I've been doing it for ages.]
772016	[There's good iron in these parts. An old king even used it to build a castle.]
772018	[Hey, You know that odd fellow? With the hulking blue sword.]
772050	[But...what's the meaning of this!]
772060	[So...guess I'll be moving along.]
772070	[I think we have similar taste. Really I do.]
772080	[Have you heard of the shrine on the eastern edge of Drangleic?]
772081	[What is that? A petrified egg?]
772082	[How very kind of you.]
772083	[Oh no, no, no, no, no, don't say that. Give a bloke a chance.]
772084	[Oh, change your mind?]
742000	[Who are you?]
742001	[I am Creighton, of Mirrah. I travel from land to land to hone my blade.]
742002	[You be careful of him. Pate, I think he said.]
742003	[Pate, the man with the strange ring. Watch out for the slimy rat.]
742050	[Do you want some? Fine enough!]
742060	[Heh... Rotten bastard...]
742070	[Here, these are for you.]
754000	[Buy something, anything... ]
754001	[Oh, you again. ]
754002	[Buy something, anything...]
754003	[Thank you kindly. Keh heh heh...]
754004	[Keh heh heh...]
754050	[My name is Melentia.]
754051	[Seemed like the battles would never end.]
754052	[Everyone's so stingy around here. ]
754053	[It's high time that I pick up and move.]
754060	[Everyone's so stingy around here. ]
754061	[We call this place Majula.]
754090	[Keh heh heh...]
754091	[You've no respect! Die, you rotten lout!]
754092	[I'll have your guts for garters! ]
754093	[Cruel, cruel world, this is... Keh heh heh...]
754094	[Keh heh heh...]
754095	[That's not very nice, is it?]
754096	[...]
770000	[I don't know who you are...But leave me be.]
770001	[Leave me alone.]
770002	[The Dark stirs...]
770004	[You are...always welcome...yes...?]
770005	[The Dark...watches over you...]
770006	[Come again...as you like...]
770007	[No matter...the time will come...]
770008	[Till we meet again.]
770009	[This land...lies closest to the Dark... Th-that is...that is why I came here.]
770010	[I w-went...I went...I went to a great school...in the south... But neither sorcery nor pyromancy appealed...I...]
770011	[Hexes originated in...ancient times.]
770012	[What drew me to the Dark...I...I...I do not know.]
770050	[You've let Dark...take control...]
770060	[Dark...deliver me...]
770070	[These...are for you...]
783000	[What is it?]
783001	[Ooh, welcome, welcome.]
783002	[You've done well to find me.]
783003	[Yes, of course, why else would you be here?]
783004	[Then you will need blood, lots of it.]
783005	[Hmm...]
783006	[Well, that's no fun...]
783007	[But if you seek Undead blood...I welcome you.]
783008	[Heh heh heh... I knew it, I knew it!]
783009	[Well, how are we?]
783010	[Know anything about Tokens of Spite? Well, you can fight other blood servants with them.]
783011	[Have you heard of the Blue Sentinels?]
783012	[Wait, you've left the Brotherhood of Blood.]
783013	[I've no use for you any more.]
783014	[Hmm... Not that I really care, but...]
783015	[Come back soon. Heh heh heh...]
783016	[Fine, either way. Heh heh heh...]
783017	[Thirsting for blood? Heh heh heh...]
783018	[Here, this is for you.]
783019	[Heh heh, wow, you're something.]
783020	[You're incredible, you really are.]
783021	[I couldn't ask for anything more.]
783050	[Well, whose blood will spill first?]
783060	[You want blood, I know you do...]
783070	[I have to say, you were bloody good. Take these, for all your trouble.]
692001	[Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.]
692002	[Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.]
692003	[Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.]
692004	[Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.]
692005	[Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.]
692006	[Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.]
692007	[Young Hollow.]
692008	[Peace grants men the illusion of life.]
692009	[All men trust fully the illusion of life.]
692010	[I am Aldia.]
725000	[Ahh, look how far this Undead has wandered.]
725001	[The Dark is still nascent within you. May the Dark shine your way...]
725002	[Young Undead, don't let this curse weigh upon you.]
725003	[May we meet again, somewhere, some time...]
725004	[We meet again, young Undead.]
725005	[There you are, you are now a Pilgrim of Dark.]
725008	[Hmm... Perhaps I was wrong.]
725009	[We meet again, young Undead.]
725010	[Then choose your own path.]
725011	[As you wish, yes, as you wish.]
725020	[Finally, you are here, young Undead.]
725021	[Young Undead, what do you desire?]
725022	[May the Dark shine your way.]
725023	[May the Dark shine your way.]
725024	[The mouth to the Dark Chasm is not normally open.]
725025	[Young Undead, may the Dark shine your way.]
725026	[Yes, very well, as you wish.]
725027	[The embrace of the Dark is gentle. Let it absorb your sorrows, forever.]
725030	[Young Undead, the Dark beset upon you runs deeper than I had imagined.]
725031	[I knew that you were special.]
725032	[Young Undead, you've discovered the truest Dark within you.]
725050	[Young Undead, do you expect me to just keel over?]
725060	[Young Undead, my work is done...]
725070	[I bequeath these to you. Take them on your pilgrimage...]
726000	[Who you?]
726001	[What? You want?]
726002	[Umm...You want? Want what?]
726003	[Umm...Gavlan know you.]
726004	[Make deal with Gavlan?]
726005	[Oh Gavlan, know you. What you want?]
726006	[You, again. Gavlan, meet you again.]
726007	[Many deal...many thanks! Gah hah!]
726008	[You? Go home?]
726009	[Umm...]
726050	[Umm...You strong.]
726060	[Wheel...deal...]
726070	[With Gavlan, you deal. Much, much deal.]
752000	[What is it?]
752001	[Phew...]
752002	[They say Drangleic brims with powerful souls.]
752003	[You are an odd one, indeed. I've always made a point of avoiding people.]
752005	[I thought that might be you. You haven't changed a bit, have you? Heh heh.]
752006	[Ah, yes, I have not thanked you for humouring me the other day.]
752007	[Our land of Mirrah is surrounded by enemies, and constantly at war.]
752008	[I was raised to wield a sword from birth.]
752009	[Have you heard of the Undead? These poor souls affected by the curse.]
752010	[I'm sorry...to burden you with talk of my fate.]
752011	[Still on the road, are you?]
752012	[I've found my thoughts growing hazy.]
752013	[I had an older brother. We learned to fence together.]
752014	[If only someone would hear my tale...]
752015	[Oh... You...]
752016	[What is this curse?]
752017	[Loss frightens me no end. Loss of memory, loss of self.]
752018	[Sometimes, I feel obsessed... with this insignificant thing called "self".]
752050	[If this is your wish, so be it.]
752060	[Please...find my brother...]
752070	[Please take these.]
600000	[The murk shifts and stirs.]
600001	[......]
692001	[Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.]
692002	[Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.]
692003	[Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.]
692004	[Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.]
692005	[Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.]
692006	[Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.]
692007	[Young Hollow.]
692008	[Peace grants men the illusion of life.]
692009	[All men trust fully the illusion of life.]
692010	[I am Aldia.]
700042	[Bearer of the curse.]
700043	[Listen to what the dragon says.]
700050	[...]
700060	[Bring an end to your journey...and mine.]
743000	[Have you business with me?]
743001	[See that statue? Gives me the willies. Stare at it for long enough, it starts to look alive.]
743002	[What?! Clearing the way was your doing, was it?]
743003	[I am in yer debt.]
743050	[Very well. I, Benhart, will be honoured to chop you to pieces.]
743060	[A man's journey...is never done...]
743070	[We have outwitted death a good many times.]
763000	[Cough! Cough cough!]
763001	[I'm fine, I think. Hrgg!]
763002	[Oh, you're that traveller!]
763003	[I was attacked, and turned to stone...I think...]
763004	[Um...I hate to burden you further, as you've already saved my life...]
763005	[Thank you so much! I'm very happy for this gift.]
763006	[I have my very own teacher.]
763007	[I'm rather unskilled... Milord probably ditched me.]
763008	[I'm going back to Majula.]
763009	[Er...could you spare me something to wear?]
763031	[I'm always here, so come and see me when you're in town!]
763032	[Be safe.]
763033	[Wait! Where are you...cough...]
763050	[How could you...]
763060	[Master...Carhillion...]
763070	[Oh, yes! These are for you!]
769000	[Are you from these parts?]
769001	[I'd heard awful rumours about this place, and I'm afraid they were all true.]
769002	[Why did I come here? Well...]
769003	[Sometimes I fight the urge to pack up and go back home.]
769004	[I expected this cathedral to be bustling, but there's hardly a soul to be found here.]
769011	[Just speak up if you're in need of miracles.]
769013	[May the power of miracles be with you.]
769014	[No need for miracles?]
769015	[Oh? Done so soon?]
769050	[Hyahh! I've no choice, now!]
769060	[Seek...miracles...]
769070	[You deserve to have these. For your faith has truly deepened.]
785000	[Transient being.]
785001	[Transient being, nothing has changed.]
785002	[Transient being.]
785003	[You are no longer a mere vagabond. You are now a guardian, a Knight of the Blue.]
785004	[Do my ears deceive me?]
785005	[You are a wandering transient.]
785006	[Ohh Gods...have mercy...]
785007	[Proud knight, you may come to me, Targray, for help.]
785008	[We Knights of the Blue must rely upon one another to achieve our greater goal.]
785009	[Proud knight, aim high in all things.]
785010	[There are others in this forsaken place who have only a lust for blood.]
785011	[Ooh... Ooooh... Unthinkable...]
785012	[Be gone... There is no mercy for your kind.]
785013	[Pursue your work, Knight of the Blue.]
785014	[Do your work, and I will lend you strength.]
785015	[Go, and be proud.]
785017	[You've achieved much, and approached a higher plane.]
785018	[Knight of the Blue, you have accomplished much.]
785019	[We walk along an endless path.]
785050	[You are my greatest challenge.]
785060	[Brave knight...be proud.]
785070	[Take these.]
307000	[Leave me be.]
307001	[What business have you here, traveller?]
307002	[Long ago, I was hired to defend the kingdom.]
307003	[I know not what brings you on this journey, nor will I deign to ask.]
307004	[I learn new things every day. Things never learned in battle.]
307005	[Farewell. May we meet again, one day soon.]
307006	[Farewell. I will retire to my silence.]
307007	[Safe travels, then...]
307008	[Back again? Well, this is a pleasant surprise.]
307009	[Ah, it was you, who vanquished my body.]
307010	[I cannot lie. Sometimes I wonder what's become of the kingdom.]
307011	[I was born in Forossa. It's a land in the distant east.]
307012	[I am grateful for these peaceful days.]
307050	[You fiend!]
307060	[I like quiet. It's all I ever wished for.]
307070	[Thank you, for lending an ear to my ramblings.]
502000	[Human, are we?]
502001	[Are you not afraid of me?]
502002	[We once had a master. He created us long, long ago.]
502003	[Our master was a tragically lonely soul.]
502004	[Nobody knows when we were born.]
502005	[I wish to ask a favour of you. I want you to kill my betrothed.]
502006	[We seem to be at a standstill. The wounds we exchange are never lethal.]
502007	[Since I speak the tongue of men, does this mean I was once human?]
502010	[You've defeated my better half.]
502011	[Long ago, there was a being with powers similar to ours.]
502012	[I have no gods to pray to.]
502050	[Have you been enslaved by madness?]
502060	[Young human...]
502070	[What skill. You've defeated my master.]
725000	[Ahh, look how far this Undead has wandered.]
725001	[The Dark is still nascent within you. May the Dark shine your way...]
725002	[Young Undead, don't let this curse weigh upon you.]
725003	[May we meet again, somewhere, some time...]
725004	[We meet again, young Undead.]
725005	[There you are, you are now a Pilgrim of Dark.]
725008	[Hmm... Perhaps I was wrong.]
725009	[We meet again, young Undead.]
725010	[Then choose your own path.]
725011	[As you wish, yes, as you wish.]
725020	[Finally, you are here, young Undead.]
725021	[Young Undead, what do you desire?]
725022	[May the Dark shine your way.]
725023	[May the Dark shine your way.]
725024	[The mouth to the Dark Chasm is not normally open.]
725025	[Young Undead, may the Dark shine your way.]
725026	[Yes, very well, as you wish.]
725027	[The embrace of the Dark is gentle. Let it absorb your sorrows, forever.]
725030	[Young Undead, the Dark beset upon you runs deeper than I had imagined.]
725031	[I knew that you were special.]
725032	[Young Undead, you've discovered the truest Dark within you.]
725050	[Young Undead, do you expect me to just keel over?]
725060	[Young Undead, my work is done...]
725070	[I bequeath these to you. Take them on your pilgrimage...]
742004	[Heh heh... Just wait, you dirty rat...]
742005	[Hm? Oh...oh! I-I remember you?!]
742006	[That bastard with the ring lives in Brightstone Cove down the way.]
742007	[For the good of the world, and for my own honour.]
742050	[Do you want some? Fine enough!]
742060	[Heh... Rotten bastard...]
775001	[Thank you for helping me. How awkward...that I fell for such a trap.]
775002	[Thank you, kind traveller.]
775050	[Oh, as you please...]
775060	[May we meet again.]
726000	[Who you?]
726001	[What? You want?]
726002	[Umm...You want? Want what?]
726003	[Umm...Gavlan know you.]
726004	[Make deal with Gavlan?]
726005	[Oh Gavlan, know you. What you want?]
726006	[You, again. Gavlan, meet you again.]
726007	[Many deal...many thanks! Gah hah!]
726008	[You? Go home?]
726009	[Umm...]
726050	[Umm...You strong.]
726060	[Wheel...deal...]
726070	[With Gavlan, you deal. Much, much deal.]
756000	[Leave this place, human.]
756001	[Thy welcome wearest thin.]
756002	[Is that a Rat Tail, human?]
756003	[Thou hast the eyes of one who perceiveth true beauty.]
756004	[Of course. Humans are all alike.]
756005	[Thou return'st?]
756006	[Then we need consort no longer.]
756007	[Speak thy mind, servant.]
756008	[My servant, tell me the way of things.]
756009	[The insolent fools line up to trample upon our burrows.]
756010	[Knowest thee of the Lockstones? Those odd contraptions fashioned by human hand long ago.]
756011	[Why comest thou here, human?]
756012	[Traitors will not be forgiven. Get thee gone.]
756013	[My servant, destroy my enemies.]
756014	[My servant, do not disappoint me.]
756015	[Go then, my servant.]
756016	[I am aware of thine accomplishments, and they are not few.]
756017	[Thy deeds are known to me. Still, there is ever more work to be done.]
756018	[My servant, well met indeed.]
756050	[I will destroy thee, filthy human!]
756060	[Adieu sweet burrow.]
756000	[Leave this place, human.]
756001	[Thy welcome wearest thin.]
756002	[Is that a Rat Tail, human?]
756003	[Thou hast the eyes of one who perceiveth true beauty.]
756004	[Of course. Humans are all alike.]
756005	[Thou return'st?]
756006	[Then we need consort no longer.]
756007	[Speak thy mind, servant.]
756008	[My servant, tell me the way of things.]
756009	[The insolent fools line up to trample upon our burrows.]
756010	[Knowest thee of the Lockstones? Those odd contraptions fashioned by human hand long ago.]
756011	[Why comest thou here, human?]
756012	[Traitors will not be forgiven. Get thee gone.]
756013	[My servant, destroy my enemies.]
756014	[My servant, do not disappoint me.]
756015	[Go then, my servant.]
756016	[I am aware of thine accomplishments, and they are not few.]
756017	[Thy deeds are known to me. Still, there is ever more work to be done.]
756018	[My servant, well met indeed.]
756050	[I will destroy thee, filthy human!]
756060	[Adieu sweet burrow.]
724000	[What are you doing here?]
724001	[I am Drummond, and the Lord has placed this fort in my hands.]
724002	[Soon, the Giants will descend upon this fort.]
724003	[Long ago, the King crossed the seas, pillaged the land of Giants, and brought back a "prize".]
724004	[Did you see him? That towering monster among them.]
724005	[Be gone with you, this fort will soon fall.]
724050	[You dare to mock me!]
724060	[Matters are settled...]
724070	[Take these. I think you may just need them.]
743030	[Oh! Look at you! Old friend!]
743031	[My homeland is in the far east. A kingdom of honourable fighting men.]
743050	[Very well. I, Benhart, will be honoured to chop you to pieces.]
743060	[A man's journey...is never done...]
743070	[We have outwitted death a good many times.]
760000	[We knew you were coming...]
760001	[We are Milfanito.]
760002	[We will sing here, forever, as we always have, from long, long ago.]
760003	[Do you seek King Vendrick?]
760004	[When we sing, the little ones dance.]
760005	[Is there anything wrong?]
760006	[We hear a song in the distance.]
760050	[What did we ever do...]
760060	[All we can do...is sing...]
760070	[You quelled that cursed singing.]
760100	[Who are you...]
760101	[Milfanito, that is what we are called.]
760102	[We sing eternally for those who bear death and Dark within themselves.]
760103	[The little ones were born from the Great Dead One.]
760104	[Do you seek comfort, too?]
760105	[We hear a song in the distance.]
760150	[What...will you do to us?]
760160	[We exist...to sing...]
760170	[You silenced that cursed singing.]
113	[There is no path.]
146	[You, who link the fire, you, who bear the curse...]
627008	[Brave Undead,]
692001	[Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.]
692002	[Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.]
692003	[Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.]
692004	[Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.]
692005	[Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity.]
692006	[Vendrick, the near-true monarch, is here, and not far off.]
692007	[Young Hollow.]
692008	[Peace grants men the illusion of life.]
692009	[All men trust fully the illusion of life.]
692010	[I am Aldia.]
692011	[You, conqueror of adversities.]
692012	[I lost everything, but remained here, patiently.]
692014	[Many monarchs have come and gone.]
700020	[Your soul is still frail and pallid...]
700044	[My journey is already complete.]
700045	[She covets the First Flame, and the Great Soul.]
700060	[Bring an end to your journey...and mine.]
702000	[You have fought admirably on your journey, cursed Undead.]
702001	[A true monarch is much more than a ruler of men.]
702002	[Brave Undead, perhaps you are the true monarch.]
702003	[Brave Undead, seek a fiercer curse.]
702004	[Brave Undead, vanquisher of King Vendrick, and bearer of the symbol of the monarch.]
702005	[Brave Undead, seek the throne.]
702006	[Brave Undead, what did that dragon tell you?]
702007	[Brave Undead, you've met that dragon? That living, breathing sham.]
702009	[Ohh...The flame...the flame...]
721100	[Who are you...]
721101	[You are a guest of our castle. I am the Chancellor, Wellager.]
721102	[My Lord made magnificent findings on souls... An accomplishment for the ages...]
721104	[The King had a dear Queen, a woman of unparalleled beauty.]
721105	[With the Golems, the king created this castle.]
721106	[A peace so deep...it was like...]
721107	[Is this...some sort of a dream?]
721108	[Welcome, visitor...]
721109	[Come back if you should require anything.]
721110	[Gone so soon?]
721111	[Where has His Royal Highness gone...]
721150	[Why, you! A traitor, have we?]
721160	[Is this...some sort of a dream?]
721170	[The King of Giants... How did you slay that behemoth?]
725000	[Ahh, look how far this Undead has wandered.]
725001	[The Dark is still nascent within you. May the Dark shine your way...]
725002	[Young Undead, don't let this curse weigh upon you.]
725003	[May we meet again, somewhere, some time...]
725004	[We meet again, young Undead.]
725005	[There you are, you are now a Pilgrim of Dark.]
725008	[Hmm... Perhaps I was wrong.]
725009	[We meet again, young Undead.]
725010	[Then choose your own path.]

725021	[Young Undead, what do you desire?]
725022	[May the Dark shine your way.]

725024	[The mouth to the Dark Chasm is not normally open.]
725025	[Young Undead, may the Dark shine your way.]
725026	[Yes, very well, as you wish.]
725027	[The embrace of the Dark is gentle. Let it absorb your sorrows, forever.]

725060	[Young Undead, my work is done...]
725070	[I bequeath these to you. Take them on your pilgrimage...]
743010	[Ho! Well met, friend.]
743011	[I journeyed from the distant east to perfect my swordsmanship.]
743012	[This land is a right mess, eh?]
743050	[Very well. I, Benhart, will be honoured to chop you to pieces.]
743060	[A man's journey...is never done...]
743070	[We have outwitted death a good many times.]
760202	[Ah...Ahh...]
760203	[Ahh...Ah...]
760250	[Ahh...Ahhh...]
760260	[Ah...Ahh...]
506000	[Halt.]
506001	[I warned you.]
506002	[I am Agdayne. Guardian of the crypt.]
506003	[I am a Fenito. We weave death, and watch over the dead.]
506004	[Did you come for him? The one called Vendrick. ]
506005	[In the past, humans were one with the dark.]
506006	[This place is welcome to all,  provided due reverence is shown.]
506007	[What do you require, human?]
506008	[Going so soon?]
506009	[Farewell, human.]
506010	[Crude human, do as you please.]
506011	[...]
506050	[Crude human, know your place!]
506060	[A long rest awaits me. Farewell, human.]
506070	[You've met the King, have you?]
692001	[Young Hollow, there are but two paths. Inherit the order of this world, or destroy it.]
692002	[Young Hollow, seek after Vendrick.]
692003	[Heheh, I believe we've been acquainted.]
692004	[Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.]

692007	[Young Hollow.]
692008	[Peace grants men the illusion of life.]
692009	[All men trust fully the illusion of life.]
692010	[I am Aldia.]
700027	[This ring is the symbol of the King.]
700028	[Bearer of the curse. Go to the east.]
700050	[(no line)]
700060	[Bring an end to your journey...and mine.]
759005	[Huh! You were not deserving of the mire…]
758101	[You've escaped Aava's jaws, and reached this forbidden land.]
758102	[Many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights followed their Lord into the Chaos.]
758103	[You've granted my one wish...]
758105	[I sense a knight's joyous elation.]
758150	[What are you...]
758160	[The great door is open.]
513001	[Fire came to be, and with it, Disparity.]
