100009	[What do you call yourself?]
10001	[Father? Mother?]
100010	[You again?]
100011	[No matter what I do, any Buddha I carve is an incarnation of wrath. ]
100013	[I've found one...]
100014	[I can... hear the ring-ring of a bell chime.]
100015	[I can... hear the ring-ring of a bell chime.]
100016	[I've gone and said much too much.]
100017	[... So you're back.]
100018	[It appears...]
100019	[Sculptor...]
100020	[I understand.]
100021	[Ohhh... I see you've acquired something quite interesting.]
100022	[Oh, you're here? Need something?]
100023	[I brought tea.]
100024	[Listen...]
100025	[.........]
100027	[You have a slightly different air about you now.]
100028	[What's that you have there...]
100030	[You see the kind-faced Buddha there...? That isn't one of mine.]
100031	[.........]
100032	[The Shinobi prosthetic...]
100033	[(Cough, cough...)]
100034	[.........]
100035	[Wait...]
100036	[.........]
100037	[I see you're here, too...]
100100	[If you want to train with that blade of yours, head to the right when you leave this ramshackle temple.]
100104	[A shinobi is only as strong as the number of tricks up his sleeve.]
100105	[If you find any other Prosthesis Upgrade Materials, bring them to me.]
100106	[You've got something quite special there.]
100107	[Some time has passed since I lifted you from that field, but--]
100108	[That's a "Shinobi Prosthesis."]
100109	[The prosthesis doesn't just compensate for your lost arm.]
100110	[I don't know the details, but--]
100112	[Why am I here?]
100113	[Some time has passed since I found you...]
100114	[My left arm... What did you do to me?]
100115	[That is what I call the Shinobi Prosthetic.  ]
100116	[What did you mean when you said they'll make use of his bloodline?]
100117	[The Dragon's Heritage.]
100118	[I brought some tea.]
100119	[I brought some sake.]
100120	[I brought something for you.]
100121	[I brought sake.]
100122	[Idols are all I can carve.]
100123	[I've abandoned the path of the Shinobi.]
100124	[.........]
100125	[Ahh.. I'm parched.]
100126	[I've held onto this charm of yours.]
100127	[Yes, I'll take it.]
100128	[.........]
100200	[You off? Alright then. Don't go falling in any pits, now.]
100201	[You're quite the strange one, yet...]
100202	[Yes, right... that kind-faced Buddha you see over there...?]
100203	[With the mechanical barrel... so many possibliites...]
100204	[If you want more forms for that fang of yours...]
100205	[... Listen.]
100206	[Another time, then.]
100207	[......... Say...]
100208	[... Hey.]
100500	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100501	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100502	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100503	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100504	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]

100506	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100507	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100508	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100509	[I see you found yourself a "Device."]
100600	[That's a "Loaded Shuriken" Upgrade. Give it here.]
100601	[That's another "Loaded Shuriken" Upgrade. Give it here.]
100602	[That's a "Gunpowder Flash" Upgrade. Give it here.]
100603	[That's another "Gunpowder Flash" Upgrade. Give it here.]

100700	[Wolf... I'm... sorry...]
100701	[Fare...well... Wolf...]
100702	[Now... I can... die...]
100703	[You... mustn't... fail...]
100704	[  ]
100705	[  ]
100706	[  ]
100707	[   ]
100708	[So these are the flames of hatred...]
100709	[Finish me... please...]
100710	[Farewell, Sculptor...]
100711	[   ]
100712	[Sculptor...]
100800	[What exactly... happened to me...?]
100801	[The Stagnation of the Dragon's Heritage... I can see it overflowing.]
100802	[(Cough, cough...)]
100803	[......... (Wheeze...)]
100804	[(Cough, cough...)]
100805	[(Cough, cough...)]
100806	[...Well? Need something else?]
100807	[.........]
100808	[.........]
100900	[(Cough, cough...)]
100901	[Orangutan... The Central Forces are here.]
100902	[Emma...]
100903	[... Emma.]
11000	[  ]
110000	[Loyal Wolf.]
110001	[There's a secret passage beneath the moat bridge that can take us out of the castle.]
110002	[Where shall we go once we're away from the castle?]
110003	[Let us press onward.]
110005	[... Wolf.]
11001	[Close your eyes. Hear the bell speak to you.]
11002	[(Sculptor coughing)]
11010	[How is grandfather?]
110100	[No...]
110101	[This is for you, My Lord.]
110102	[Suffering is what I desire.]
110103	[I see.]
11011	[Impressive, Shinobi of the Divine Heir.]
11012	[You were victorious, I see.]
11013	[I remember you well.]
11014	[Why, boy?]
11015	[Sekiro...]
11016	[I expected no less from you, my boy.]
11017	[That took a while...]
11019	[Lord Takeru's dragon blood...]
11020	[  ]
11021	[Some twenty years after Isshin's coup, the Ashina clan --]
11022	[  ]
11023	[  ]
11024	[The Divine Heir... ]
11025	[  ]
11026	[  ]
11027	[Bastard...]
11028	[Wolf...where are you?]
11029	[Wolf... where are you?]
11030	[Wolf...where..where are you?]
110400	[Wolf.]
110500	[Wolf, you said to me once--]
111000	[Well done... ]
111001	[According to ancient Ashina folklore... ]
111002	[It appears you found the Fountainhead Village's Sacred Treasure.]
111003	[So you found the Bodhissatva Valley's Sacred Treasure.]
111004	[The Fountainhead Village and the Bodhissatva Valley. You have done well to find both Sacred Treasures.]
111005	[Now we have the two Sacred Treasures and Immortal Edge.]
111006	[The Hachiyouji Temple Page may know something about the last Sacred Treasure's whereabouts.]
111020	[We managed to drive them back once.]
111021	[... it's been a long time since... that happened.]
111022	[I have come for you, my lord.]
111023	[If we are seeking to sever the immortal ties, I know a good place to start.]
111024	[Is there something special about it...?]
111025	[Now, as to how we begin our search...]
111026	[Lord Isshin is not within this castle citadel.  I'm told he is recuperating in one of these watchtowers.]
111027	[Find Lord Isshin... and ask if he knows how we might sever the ties of immortality.]
111028	[(cough) Hmm... This dust is awful.]
111029	[I must ascertain the secret to the aroma of the fountainhead so that we may reach the divine realm.]
111030	[I see you've gathered some of the ingredients needed to create the aroma of the fountainhead.]
111031	[Wolf, look here.]
111032	[My Lord, the incense burner...]
111033	[I asked Lady Emma about the sakura tree.]
111034	[My Lord, I've procured the flower for the fountainhead aroma.]
111035	[My Lord, I have procured the ingredients for the aroma.]
111036	[Oh, and actually...]
111037	[To think my blood is an ingredient of the aroma...]
111038	[Wolf, did you speak with Lady Emma?]
111039	[Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...]
111040	[Wolf, you're back.]
111041	[I'll make something nice for you with the rice you gave me.]
111042	[Sorry to keep you waiting, Wolf.]
111043	[It's a sweet sticky rice ball made from the rice you gave me.]
111044	[How was the rice ball?]
111045	[Wolf...]
111046	[Wolf... We've finally done it.]
111047	[My Lord...]
111048	[Wolf, I need you to bring Dragon Tears from the divine realm...]
111049	[My Lord...]
111050	[.........]
111051	[.........]
111052	[It appears...]
111053	[I've just remembered, Wolf.]
111054	[Oh, that's right...]
111100	[The Sacred Treasures follow the Rejuvenating Waters.]
111101	[Bodhissatva Valley runs along the back of Ashina Castle, beyond the Great White's shrine.]
111102	[The Fountainhead Village can be found at the lowest point of Ashina.]
111103	[Ah yes, my grandfather, Isshin Ashina may possess some knowledge of the curse.]
111104	[You can find him resting in his quarters.]
111105	[Father...]
111106	[I cannot.]
111107	[My Lord, please take a look at this.]
111108	[... I've seen that bell before.]
111109	[My Lord, this is for you...]
111110	[A flower?]
111111	[One part of the fountainhead aroma...]
111112	[My Lord, this is for you.]
111113	[A fragrant stone, a sacred village, all beneath Ashina...]
111114	[It says there's a fragrant stone and a sacred village, all beneath Ashina...]
111115	[I did not.]
111116	[The scent in the incense burner reminded me of a sakura tree.]
111117	[So the Everblossom has withered and no longer remains...]
111118	[I must remain vigilant...]
111119	[I must remain vigilant...]
111120	[... My Lord.]
111121	[.........]
111200	[I suppose you should go.]
111201	[I suppose you should go.]
111202	[I suppose you should go.]
111203	[I suppose you should go.]
111204	[Ah yes, my grandfather, Isshin Ashina may possess some knowledge of the curse.]
111206	[Ahh, I meant to ask.]
111207	[You're leaving.]
111208	[I've just remembered, Wolf...]
111400	[Thank you, Wolf.]
111401	[This is... very good...]
111402	[Too shy to eat it in front of me?]
111403	[(sneezing)]
111500	[(sleeping)]
111501	[......... Hmm... ]
111502	[Mm... Mmhm... ]
111503	[When did you...]
111504	[......... He's...]
111505	[We're almost there.]
111600	[...It is time, Lady Emma.]
111601	[The smoke rising above the rooftops...]
112500	[This man... was from Hirata.]
112501	[We managed to drive them back once.]
112502	[Lady Emma, tell me... what has caused the state of this man?]
120000	[Father...]
120300	[That day...]
120301	[Hmm...]
120302	[What a fine specimen you've become, Wolf.]
120303	[I told you, didn't I?]
120304	[Farewell...]
120305	[Good riddance... starving wolf.]
120306	[.........]
120307	[The fire's too strong... need to find another way through.]
121000	[Father...]
121002	[...As you command.]
121003	[...I cannot do as you ask.]
121004	[Now, you will help me retrieve him, that impudent child.]
121005	[... Yes. The code is absolute.]
121006	[Remember the first rule of the code.  As your father, I order you to forsake your master.]
121300	[...Enough talk!]
121301	[...it warms my heart, Wolf.]
121302	[One...!]
121303	[Two...!]
121304	[Three...!]
121305	[No more than a stray dog after all.]
121306	[...Farewell]
121307	[... Yes. The code is absolute.]
121600	[WAIT... wait, please!]
121601	[My son!  A moment!]
121602	[You fool!]
121603	[Gullible as ever!]
121604	[Now you're mine!]
121605	[Have at it, boy.]
121606	[This saddens me...]
121607	[The "Returning Owl."]
121608	[   ]
121609	[Very well!]
121610	[Death of a shadow...]
121611	[You taught me well.]
121612	[That's... my boy...]
121613	[W-Wait!]
121614	[Never let down your guard!]
130000	[Hmm? ...Never seen you before.]
130001	[Hmm...]
130002	[That swordsmanship...]
130003	[Oh, it's you.]
130004	[About our training... I think it's about time we tried something closer to a real fight, don't you?]
130006	[Oh, it’s you.]
130007	[Now, let's begin.]
130008	[Once again, a satisfying match.]
130010	[That sword on your back...]
130011	[I can finally die.]
130012	[  ]
130013	[I will prepare for the beyond. The next time you see me, I'll be ready.]
130014	[Have you noticed...]
130015	[This temple attracts those with nowhere else to go.]
130100	[In that case, I stand as your opponent.]
130101	[Very well.]
130102	[No.]
130103	[I'm sorry.]
130104	[You have my gratitude.]
130105	[Feel like talking about that sword on your back now?]
130106	[So...]
130107	[The Mortal Blade.]
130108	[This...?]
130109	[I will... of course.]
130110	[.........No.]
130200	[Come back whenever you like.]
130300	[Excellent... I expected no less of you.]
130301	[A satisfying match.]
130302	[Yes, splendidly done.]
130303	[Again!]
130304	[One more time.  ]
130305	[Face me again. ]
130306	[What's wrong?]
130307	[Something wrong?]
130308	[Attack me.  ]
